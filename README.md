## **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

---

### **Overview**
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game implemented in Java. The goal is to align three marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid before your opponent does. This project is simple, interactive, and perfect for beginners to understand the basics of game logic in Java.

### **How to Play**
1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 uses **X**, and Player 2 uses **O**.
3. Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty spot.
4. The first player to align three of their symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all spots are filled and no one aligns three symbols, the game ends in a draw.

### **Features**

- **Turn-by-turn gameplay**: Prompts players to take their turns.
